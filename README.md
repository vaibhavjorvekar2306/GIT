* What is Git ?

1) Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. 
2) Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
3) Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

* Why Used Git ? 

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that enables you to store code, track revision history, merge code changes, and revert to earlier code version when needed. Git stores your source code and its full development history locally in a repository.

--> Here are some of the reasons why you should use Git:

1) Version control:
   
Git allows you to track changes to your code over time. This is important because it allows you to revert to previous versions of your code if you make a mistake.

2) Collaboration:
   
Git makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same codebase. This is because Git allows you to create branches, which are essentially copies of the codebase that you can work on independently. Once you're finished working on your branch, you can merge it back into the main codebase.

3) Speed:

Git is a very fast VCS. This is because Git stores the entire history of your codebase locally. This means that you don't have to wait for a server to respond when you want to make a change to your code.

4) Security:

Git is a very secure VCS. This is because Git uses cryptography to protect your code.
Overall, Git is a great VCS for any software development project. It is fast, secure, and easy to use.


-Here are some additional benefits of using Git:
  
1) Branching:

Git allows you to create branches, which are essentially copies of the codebase that you can work on independently. This is useful for working on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

2) Merging:
   
Git makes it easy to merge changes from different branches back into the main codebase. This is important for collaborating with other developers.

3) Rebasing:

Git allows you to rebase your changes, which means that you can move your changes to a different branch without creating a merge commit. This can be useful for keeping your history clean.

4) Stashing:

Git allows you to stash your changes, which means that you can save your changes without committing them. This is useful if you need to switch to a different branch or if you need to make a temporary change.

5) Tagging:

Git allows you to tag your commits, which means that you can create markers in your history. This can be useful for marking releases or for tracking specific changes.
If you are working on a software development project, I highly recommend using Git. It is a great VCS that can help you to be more productive and to collaborate more effectively with other developers.
